What are some major COVID-19 Patterns (cases and deaths) when stratified by states/regions, and if necessary, specific counties of the state? What are some patterns that can signal a major upcoming wave? (e.g. if we see a steady growth in cases/deaths for x consecutive days, does that tell us a bigger picture about the state of COVID-19 in the US or a specific state?) "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources COVID-19 caught the world’s attention in January 2020 when the first several cases were reported in Wuhan, China. It quickly spread to places including Iran, South Korea, and Italy in February, and the US had its first wave in March. Since then, over 10 million cases were reported and over 260,000 Americans died. Our group wants to study the patterns in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States on national and state levels and recently learned about the COVID Tracking Project (https://covidtracking.com/) at the Atlantic. The data API page has historical COVID-19 data on the national level (https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/us/daily.csv) and state level (https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/states/daily.csv). The data is also available in json format, but we will proceed with the csv format. The national level data has the date on a daily basis, cumulative number of positive and negative test results, number of current and cumulative hospitalized people, number of current and cumulative people on ventilators, number of recovered people, and the number of deaths for each day. The state level data has similar information, but for each state. However, certain rows such as antibody test results are not available for every state, so we will proceed with columns mentioned above, which are available for all states. We can also feature engineer and calculate the number of new cases/hospitalizations/deaths/test results. Furthermore, we will research throughout the project to gather the current events data for the United States in 2020. These data points will be used in the visualizations as key dates that could have sparked an increase in the COVID-19 cases (e.g. Easter, Memorial Day, Protests, Election). At first, we will refer to “2020 in the United States” Wikipedia page to find more reliable sources about the important events and their settings in 2020. The sources will increase throughout the project and they will be cited in Works Cited. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The data comes for the most part in a format that is ready to make visualizations and do EDA for our project. We intend to transform some variables into factor variables and create new grouping variables based off of continuous variables. For example, we will segment states based on positive tests into “high”, “med”, “low”. In addition, we will do that for as well for death counts. We will then create factors out of these variables. Most of the variables are already in a usable format and we do not need to transform too much. We will also create variables for month day and year by breaking apart the data variable. This will allow us to see daily trends and monthly trends. Potentially the data quality grade icon can give us better information. We will also create a grouping variable regarding the data quality to ensure we look at datapoints that are consistent in quality with each other. The data quality variable consists from a spectrum from A-F. We will explore dropping low grade data points since the sample of those data points are extremely small.

Most missing pattern does not differ a lot in type and number variables. If we sort the graph by colum, the variable with the highest number of missing values is ‘totalTestPeopleAntigen’. Additionally, it’s not hard to see that the variables associated with the number of individuals of positive and negative results of different tests have a large number of missing values. Most categorical variables such as “fips” and “dataQualityGrade” does not have missing values. If we sort the graph by both column and row, the distribution of the length of missing pattern becomes approximately uniform. The general shape becomes flatter.
