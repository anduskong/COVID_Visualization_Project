# Introduction

We wanted to answer some of these questions:

What are some major COVID-19 patterns (cases and deaths) in the US, in relation to major domestic events?

What are some major COVID-19 Patterns (cases and deaths) when stratified by states/regions, and if necessary, specific counties of the state?

What are some patterns that can signal a major upcoming wave? (e.g. if we see a steady growth in cases/deaths for x consecutive days, does that tell us a bigger picture about the state of COVID-19 in the US or a specific state?)
