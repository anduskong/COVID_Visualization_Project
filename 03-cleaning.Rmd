# Data transformation

The data comes for the most part in a format that is ready to make visualizations and perform exploratory data analysis. We will transform some variables into factor variables and create new grouping variables based on the continuous variables. For example, we will segment states based on positive tests and deaths into "high", "med", "low". We will then create factors out of these variables. Most of the variables are already in a usable format and does not require further transformation. We will also create variables for day and month by feature engineering from the date variable, which will allow us to visualize daily and monthly trends.

In the dataset, there is a data quality grade icon. For each row of data, the data quality icon consists of a grade between A and F. We will create a grouping variable based on the data quality to ensure that we are working with data points of similar calibre. We will explore dropping low grade data points since the sample of those data points are extremely small.
