# Data transformation

The data comes for the most part in a format that is ready to make visualizations and do EDA for our project. We intend to transform some variables into factor variables and create new grouping variables based off of continuous variables. For example, we will segment states based on positive tests into "high", "med", "low". In addition, we will do that for as well for death counts. We will then create factors out of these variables. Most of the variables are already in a usable format and we do not need to transform too much. We will also create variables for month day and year by breaking apart the data variable. This will allow us to see daily trends and monthly trends. Potentially the data quality grade icon can give us better information. We will also create a grouping variable regarding the data quality to ensure we look at datapoints that are consistent in quality with each other. The data quality variable consists from a spectrum from A-F. We will explore dropping low grade data points since the sample of those data points are extremely small.
